### 2025-08-12-17:00:00 - ü¶Ñ ai that works: decoding context engineering lessons from Manus

**Description**: ü¶Ñ ai that works



A few weeks ago, the Manus team published an excellent paper on context engineering. It covered KV Cache, Hot-swapping tools with custom samplers, and a ton of other cool techniques.
On this week's episode, we'll dive deep on the manus Article and put some of the advice into practice, exploring how a deep understanding of models and inference can help you to get the most out of today's LLMs.

### 2025-08-05-17:00:00 - ü¶Ñ ai that works: advanced context engineering for coding agents

**Description**: ü¶Ñ ai that works




By popular demand, AI That Works #17 will dive deep on a new kind of context engineering: managing research, specs, and planning to get the most of coding agents and coding CLIs.
You've heard people bragging about spending thousands/mo on Claude Code, maxing out Amp limits, and much more. Now Dex and Vaibhav are gonna share some tips and tricks for pushing AI coding tools to their absolute limits, while still shipping well-tested, bug-free code. This isn't vibe-coding, this is something completely different.

### 2025-07-29-17:00:00 - ü¶Ñ ai that works: Eval-ing multiple models for each prompt

**Description**: ü¶Ñ ai that works




AI That Works #16 will be a super-practical deep dive into real-world examples and techniques for evaluating a single prompt against multiple models. While this is a commonly heralded use case for Evals, e.g. "how do we know if the new model is better" / "how do we know if the new model breaks anything", there's not a ton of practical examples out there for real-world use cases.

On this episode we'll do a ton of hands-on live coding to look at different ways to slice and dice your prompt library to test and evolve it while understanding performance with different models.

### 2025-07-22-17:00:00 - ü¶Ñ ai that works: PDFs, Multimodality, Vision Models

**Description**: ü¶Ñ ai that works


For AI That Works #15 - we're going deep on a question that comes up nearly every week on the show - what are the best ways to process PDFs and other image-based data?
We'll dig into questions like:
Do you always need PyMuPDF or equivalent?
Vision Models vs. multimodal?
What makes the Gemini PDF processor so good?

### 2025-07-15-17:00:00 - ü¶Ñ ai that works: Implementing Decaying-Resolution Memory

**Description**: ü¶Ñ ai that works


Last week on #13, we did a conceptual deep dive on context engineering and memory - this week, we're going to jump right into the weeds and implement a version of Decaying-Resolution Memory that you can pick up and apply to your AI Agents today. For this episode, you'll probably want to check out episode #13 in the session listing to get caught up on DRM and why its worth building from scratch.

### 2025-08-19-17:00:00 - ü¶Ñ ai that works: Interruptable agents

**Description**: ü¶Ñ ai that works


Anyone can build a chatbot, but what sets chatbots apart is the UX the provide. Can i cancel a message? Can I queue commands while its running something else? How fine-grained can i steer the agent? Lets code together :)

### 2025-08-26-17:00:00 - ü¶Ñ ai that works: Claude for non-code tasks

**Description**: ü¶Ñ ai that works


On #17 we talked about advanced context engineering workflows for using Claude code to work in complex codebases. This week, we're gonna get a little weird with it, and show off a bunch of ways you can use Claude Code as a generic agent to handle non-coding tasks.  We'll learn things like:
Skipping the MCP and having claude write its own scripts to interact with external systems
Creating internal knowledge graphs with markdown files
How to blend agentic retrieval and search with deterministic context packing
