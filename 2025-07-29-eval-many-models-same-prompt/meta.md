title: S02E12 â€“ Evaluating Prompts Across Models
description: "AI That Works #16 will be a super-practical deep dive into
  real-world examples and techniques for evaluating a single prompt against
  multiple models. While this is a commonly heralded use case for Evals, e.g.
  'how do we know if the new model is better' / 'how do we know if the new model
  breaks anything', there's not a ton of practical examples out there for
  real-world use cases."
