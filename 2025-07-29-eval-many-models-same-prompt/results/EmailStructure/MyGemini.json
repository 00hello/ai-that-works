{"subject": "Recap: Cracking the Prompting Interview", "body": "Hello First Name,\n\nThis week's \ud83e\udd84 ai that works session was on \"Cracking the Prompting Interview\"!\n\nThe full recording, code, and whiteboards from the session are now available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/hellovai/ai-that-works\n\nWe covered a lot on prompt engineering techniques and LLM optimization strategies. Here\u2019s a super quick recap:\n\n- Shift Complexity from Prompts to Code: Instead of asking an LLM to handle complex logic or strict formatting, use it for the core reasoning task. Offload deterministic parts\u2014like structuring JSON or applying business rules\u2014to your application code for more reliable and maintainable systems.\n\n- Use Aliases to Reduce Tokens and Improve Accuracy: When dealing with a known set of options (e.g., categories, statuses), have the LLM output a short alias or index (like `1` for \"Approved\"). Your code can then map this back to the full text, saving tokens and preventing spelling mistakes.\n\n- Guide the LLM with Structure, Not Just Examples: A well-structured prompt using clear headings, XML tags, and even inline comments can guide the model\u2019s reasoning process more effectively than just providing examples. This gives you more control over the output without cluttering it.\n\nIf you remember one thing from this session:\nAlways Read The Final Prompt (RTFP). Before you debug your code or the LLM's output, inspect the exact final prompt your system generated. Often, the bug isn't in the LLM\u2019s reasoning but in how your code constructed the instructions.\n\nOur next session on July 15th, 2025 will be all about \"Generating AI-powered Content with LLMs\" \u2013 exploring how to use LLMs to generate content for various use cases.\nSign up here: https://lu.ma/ai-that-works-12\n\nIf you have any questions, reply to this email or ask on Discord: https://www.boundaryml.com/discord.
