{"subject": "Session Recap: Cracking the Prompting Interview", "body": "Hello {{first_name}},\n\nThanks for coming to this week's session on \\\"Cracking the Prompting Interview\\\"! We had a great discussion on prompt engineering techniques and LLM optimization strategies.\n\nThe full recording and resources from the session are now available.\n\nWe covered a lot, but here are the main takeaways:\n\n**It's an Engineered System, Not Just a Single Prompt:** The best results come from treating the LLM as one part of a larger system. Shift complex logic and formatting to your own deterministic code. To save on tokens and cost, have the LLM output simple aliases or indexes that your application can map back to the full content.\n\n**Structure is King:** A well-structured prompt, using techniques like inline comments to guide the LLM's reasoning, is often more powerful and reliable than simply adding more real-world examples.\n\nIf you remember one thing from this session:\n**RTFP (Read the *Full* Prompt)**. Before you start debugging your code or the model's output, always take a moment to understand how the LLM is interpreting your instructions. The problem is almost always in the prompt.\n\nOur next session on July 15th, 2025 will be all about \\\"Generating AI-powered Content with LLMs\\\" \u2013 exploring how to use LLMs to generate content for various use cases.", "call_to_action": "Sign up here: https://lu.ma/ai-that-works-12"}
