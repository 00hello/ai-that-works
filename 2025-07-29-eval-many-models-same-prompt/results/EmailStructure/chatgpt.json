    "body": "Thanks for attending our session on advanced prompt engineering and LLM optimization strategies! Here's a quick summary of what we covered and what to keep in mind:\n\nðŸ’¡ Main Takeaways:\n- Shift complex generation tasks to deterministic code.\n- Use indexes or aliases instead of full text to save tokens.\n- Provide clear indexes and structured input to improve LLM focus.\n- Guide LLM reasoning with inline comments (even in JSON).\n- Structure prompts instead of relying on real-world examples.\n- Donâ€™t make the LLM count â€“ pre-process or enforce constraints with code.\n- Leverage broken JSON and code for natural LLM generation.\n- Avoid role-playing; give clear, concise instructions.\n- RTFP: Read the F***ing Prompt before debugging.\n- Always structure output to match actionable, specific needs.\n\nðŸ“Œ Quick Recap:\n- Shift complex logic to code\n- Use aliases instead of full text\n- Add inline comments for LLM reasoning\n- Structure prompts instead of examples\n\nðŸ§­ One thing to remember:\nFocus on actionable insights by structuring output to match specific needs and workflows.",
