{"subject": "Recap: Advanced Prompting Techniques & LLM Optimization", "body": "Hello First Name,\n\nThis week's \ud83e\udd84 ai that works session was on \"Advanced Prompting Techniques & LLM Optimization\"!\n\nThe full recording, code, and examples from the session are now available on GitHub:\n[Your GitHub Link Here]\n\nWe covered a lot of ground on making LLMs more reliable and efficient. Here\u2019s a quick recap:\n\n- **Shift Complexity from Prompts to Code:** Instead of asking an LLM to perform complex logic or formatting (like calculating totals or formatting dates), let it handle the core reasoning. Use reliable, deterministic code for the rest. This makes your system more robust and easier to debug.\n- **Use Aliases & Indexes for Efficiency:** To dramatically reduce token costs, have the LLM output short indexes or aliases instead of full text for predefined categories. For example, output \"STATUS_2\" instead of \"Awaiting Customer Reply.\" Your application can then map this alias to the full text.\n- **Guide with Structure and Comments:** A well-defined output structure (like a JSON schema with descriptive comments) is often more powerful than providing many examples. Use inline comments to guide the LLM's reasoning process without cluttering the final output, ensuring you get clean, structured data every time.\n\nIf you remember one thing from this session:\nTreat the LLM as a powerful but flexible component in a larger system. Offload complex logic and validation to your own code to build more robust, efficient, and cost-effective AI applications.\n\nOur next session on July 15th, 2025 will be all about \"Generating AI-Powered Content with LLMs\" \u2013 exploring how to use LLMs to generate high-quality content for various use cases.\nSign up here: https://lu.ma/ai-that-works-12\n\nIf you have any questions, reply to this email or ask on Discord: [Your Discord Link Here].
