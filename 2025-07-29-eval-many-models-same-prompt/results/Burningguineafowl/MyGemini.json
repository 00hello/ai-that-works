{"subject": "Recap: Advanced Prompting & LLM Optimization", "body": "Hello [First Name],\n\nThis week's \ud83e\udd84 AI that Works session was on \"Advanced Prompting & LLM Optimization\"!\n\nThe full recording, code, and examples from the session are now available:\n[Link to Your GitHub/Resource Hub]\n\nWe covered a lot on building more efficient and reliable LLM systems. Here\u2019s a super quick recap:\n\n*   **Shift Complexity from Prompts to Code:** Instead of asking the LLM to handle complex logic or formatting, offload those tasks to deterministic application code. Use the LLM for reasoning and generation, and let your code handle the structured, repeatable parts for better reliability and lower costs.\n\n*   **Optimize for Tokens with Structure:** Drastically reduce token usage by having the LLM output simple indexes or aliases instead of verbose text. Combine this with well-structured prompts that define the output format\u2014this is often more effective than relying on a few real-world examples.\n\n*   **Guide Reasoning with Inline Comments:** Steer the LLM's thought process without cluttering the final output. By adding comments directly within your prompt's structure (e.g., in a JSON template), you can provide instructions that guide the model's logic internally.\n\nIf you remember one thing from this session:\nFocus on actionable insights by structuring the LLM's output to match your specific needs and workflows. Treat it as an engineered system where the LLM is one component, not the entire solution.", "call_to_action": "Our next session on July 15th, 2025 will be all about \"Generating AI-powered Content with LLMs\" \u2013 exploring how to use LLMs to generate content for various use cases.\nSign up here: https://lu.ma/ai-that-works-12\n\nIf you have any questions, reply to this email.
