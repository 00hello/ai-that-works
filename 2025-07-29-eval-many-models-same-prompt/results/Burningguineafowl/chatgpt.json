    "body": "Thanks for joining us for “Cracking the Prompting Interview” – we covered a ton of practical insights on prompt engineering and LLM optimization. Here's a quick recap to keep handy:\n\n💡 Top Takeaways\n- Shift complex generation to deterministic code – don’t make the LLM do what code can do better.\n- Reduce token usage – use indexes or aliases instead of full strings.\n- Guide LLM reasoning – use inline comments, even in JSON, to nudge the model (without affecting output).\n- Don’t have the LLM count things – pass in pre-computed values or enforce constraints in code.\n- Structure > Examples – structured prompts give you more control than relying on real-world samples.\n- Stop roleplaying – clear instructions beat “You are a helpful assistant…”\n- RTFP – Read the F***ing Prompt before debugging anything.\n\n📌 Best Practices Snapshot\n- Use indexes instead of full text\n- Structure your prompts clearly\n- Let code handle deterministic logic\n- Add inline comments for reasoning cues\n- Design prompts with actionable output in mind\n\n👉 What’s Next?\nOur next session is coming up on July 15th, 2025:\n“Generating AI-Powered Content with LLMs”\nLearn how to use LLMs to generate engaging, high-quality content for real-world use cases.",
