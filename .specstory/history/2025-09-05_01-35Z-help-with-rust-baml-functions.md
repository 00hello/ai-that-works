# Help with rust baml functions (2025-09-05 01:35Z)

_**User (2025-09-05 01:35Z)**_

Looking at @ARCHITECTURE.md and @BAML-RUST.md I've made some rust BAML functions

They're in @basic-rust-baml/ 

You're going to help me


---

_**Assistant**_

I see you've been working on creating Rust BAML functions! Looking at the architecture documents and your `basic-rust-baml` directory, I can see you've set up a Rust project that uses a local `baml-client` path dependency.

Let me examine your current setup to understand what you've built and how I can help you.

Now let me check your BAML source files to understand the functions you've defined:

Now let me also check the generated OpenAPI spec and some key files in the generated client:

Perfect! I can see what you've built. You've successfully created a Rust BAML project using the OpenAPI generation approach. From the architecture documents, I understand this is the current workaround for Rust support since native Rust client generation isn't implemented yet.

Here's what you have:

## Your Current Setup

1. **BAML Functions**: You've defined an `ExtractResume` function that takes a resume string and returns a structured `Resume` object with name, email, experience, and skills.

2. **Generated Rust Client**: Using BAML's OpenAPI generator, you've created a Rust HTTP client that can call your BAML functions via REST API.

3. **Working Example**: Your `main.rs` demonstrates calling the `ExtractResume` function with a sample resume about Tony Hoare.

Let me run your example to see how it works:

---

```bash
cd /Users/david/projects/learning/learn_baml/ai-that-works/basic-rust-baml && cargo run
```

```

I see the issue! The generated `ExtractResumeRequest` struct has an additional field that needs to be provided. Let me check the request model:

---

Perfect! I can see the issue and the solution. Let me fix your `main.rs` file:

      }).await.unwrap();

Actually, let me use the constructor method instead, which is cleaner:

Now let's try running it again. But first, I should check if you have a BAML server running, since this is using the REST API approach:

---

```bash
cargo run
```

```

    ],

        "Algorithms",

    ],
}
```

---

Excellent! Your Rust BAML client is working perfectly! üéâ 

The function successfully extracted structured data from the unstructured text about Tony Hoare, parsing out:
- **Name**: "Tony Hoare"
- **Experience**: A list of his contributions
- **Skills**: Technical areas he worked in
- **Email**: Empty (as expected, since none was provided in the input)

## What You've Successfully Built

You've implemented a **working Rust client for BAML** using the OpenAPI generation approach. This demonstrates:

1. **Schema-driven extraction**: Your `Resume` class in BAML automatically generated type-safe Rust structs
2. **LLM integration**: The function successfully called OpenAI's GPT-4o to process the text
3. **Type safety**: The response is properly typed as a `Resume` struct in Rust

## How I Can Help You Further

Now that your basic setup is working, here are some ways I can help you expand and improve your Rust BAML implementation:

### 1. **Add More Complex BAML Functions**
- Multi-step processing pipelines
- Functions with different return types (enums, unions, nested objects)
- Functions that work with images, PDFs, or other media types

### 2. **Improve Error Handling**
- Replace `.unwrap()` with proper error handling
- Add retry logic and fallback strategies
- Handle different types of API failures gracefully

### 3. **Add More Advanced Features**
- Streaming responses (though limited in OpenAPI approach)
- Multiple client configurations
- Custom validation logic

### 4. **Create More Sophisticated Data Models**
- Complex nested structures
- Union types for different document formats
- Validation constraints and business logic

### 5. **Build a Real Application**
- Document processing pipeline
- Data extraction service
- Multi-modal content analysis

What would you like to work on next? I can help you:
- Add more BAML functions with different capabilities
- Improve the error handling and robustness
- Create a more complex application that showcases BAML's power
- Explore the limitations and workarounds of the OpenAPI approach
- Or anything else you're curious about!

What did you fix

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at what I fixed in your Rust BAML code:

## The Problem
Your original code had a compilation error because the generated `ExtractResumeRequest` struct was missing a required field:

```rust
// Your original code - FAILED to compile
let resp = b::extract_resume(&config, ExtractResumeRequest {
    resume: "Tony Hoare is a British computer scientist...".to_string(),
    // ‚ùå Missing __baml_options__ field
}).await.unwrap();
```

The compiler error was:
```
error[E0063]: missing field `__baml_options__` in initializer of `ExtractResumeRequest`
```

## The Root Cause
When BAML generates the OpenAPI specification and then uses `openapi-generator` to create the Rust client, it includes an optional `__baml_options__` field in request structs. This field allows passing additional BAML-specific configuration options.

Looking at the generated struct:
```rust
#[derive(Clone, Default, Debug, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct ExtractResumeRequest {
    #[serde(rename = "resume")]
    pub resume: String,
    #[serde(rename = "__baml_options__", skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]
    pub __baml_options__: Option<models::BamlOptions>,  // ‚Üê This was missing
}
```

## The Fix
I changed your code to use the constructor method provided by the generated client:

```rust
// Fixed version - uses the constructor
let request = ExtractResumeRequest::new(
    "Tony Hoare is a British computer scientist...".to_string()
);

let resp = b::extract_resume(&config, request).await.unwrap();
```

The `new()` constructor automatically sets `__baml_options__` to `None`, which is the correct default value.

## Why This Happened
This is a characteristic of the **OpenAPI generation approach** for Rust BAML clients. As mentioned in the `BAML-RUST.md` document, this approach has some limitations compared to native clients - including these kinds of implementation details leaking through to the user code.

The native clients (Python, TypeScript, Go) handle these internal fields automatically, but the OpenAPI-generated Rust client requires you to be aware of them.

**Bottom line**: I fixed a missing field compilation error by using the proper constructor method instead of struct literal initialization.

Perfect! I can see you're on the `basic-baml` branch and have your Rust BAML work as untracked files. Now let me:

1. Update the remote to point to your fork
2. Add and commit your changes
3. Push the branch to your fork
