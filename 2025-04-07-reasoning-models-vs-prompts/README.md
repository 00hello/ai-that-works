## Running this code

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

```bash
# Convert BAML files -> TypeScript
pnpm run generate
```

```bash
# Run the code
pnpm run dev
```

## Followup Exercises

What workflows do you have that you can add reasoning to?

What reasoning workflows can you replace with smaller cheaper models?

## Session Notes

### Key Takeaways

- You can make a cheap model do reasoning just by prompting it well
- Time management of your Engineering Team
     - o3 / reasoning model if you just wanna move fast
- Cost management / speed corollary
     - if you need performance / speed / choice 
     - if you can only run small models e.g. OSS or at the edge
- better prompts / guided reasoning, better than generic <THINK> 
  tokens in general-purpose models
     - you can make a good reasoning model even better with guided reasoning
- actor / checker / llm-as-judge workflows may work but are exponential in cost / latency
