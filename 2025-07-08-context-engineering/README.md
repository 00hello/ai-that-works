## Key Takeaways

- Context engineering unifies RAG, memory, and prompts into a single system design challenge
- Decaying Resolution Memory (DRM) provides a scalable approach to long-term agent memory
- Semantic, human-like tools improve agent capabilities while maintaining security boundaries
- Success criteria and user experience should drive memory architecture decisions
- Proactive context injection reduces complexity and improves reliability
- Summarization requires existing context to determine relevance and importance
- Complex operations should be handled in application code, not prompts

## Core Architecture

The system architecture consists of three main components:

1. Context Assembly Layer
   - Manages prompt composition and token optimization
   - Combines instructions, RAG results, and memory
   - Handles deterministic data injection (date, user profile, etc.)

2. Memory Management System
   - Implements Decaying Resolution Memory (DRM)
   - Progressive summarization of historical context
   - Maintains multiple resolution levels (detailed recent, summarized older)
   - Automatic pruning and consolidation of older memories

3. Tool Integration Framework
   - Sandboxed, user-scoped tool definitions
   - Semantic API endpoints (check_calendar, search_inbox)
   - State management outside of prompt context
   - Security boundary enforcement

The system follows these key principles:
- All context elements are treated as token engineering problems
- Memory is lossy by design, optimized for relevance
- Tools mirror human workflows and mental models
- Complex operations are handled in application code
- Context is proactively managed and injected
