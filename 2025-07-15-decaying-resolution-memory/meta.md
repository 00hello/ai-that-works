title: S02E10 â€“ Implementing Decaying-Resolution Memory
description: "Last week on #13, we did a conceptual deep dive on context
  engineering and memory - this week, we're going to jump right into the weeds
  and implement a version of Decaying-Resolution Memory that you can pick up and
  apply to your AI Agents today. For this episode, you'll probably want to check
  out episode #13 in the session listing to get caught up on DRM and why its
  worth building from scratch."
