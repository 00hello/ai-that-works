title: "S02E02 â€“ Policy to Prompt: Evaluating w/ the Enron Emails Dataset"
description: One of the most common problems in AI engineering is looking at a
  set of policies/rules and evaluating evidence to determine if the rules were
  followed. In this session we'll explore turning policies into prompts and
  pipelines to evaluate which emails in the massive Enron email dataset violated
  SEC and Sarbanes-Oxley regulations.
