‚Äãto prevent repeating the basics, we recommend you come in having already understanding some of the tooling we will be using:

* zoom 
* ‚Äãcursor (a vscode alternative)

    * ‚Äãapplication logic: python or typescript or go (depends on session)
    * ‚Äãprompting: baml
        * repo: [github.com/boundaryml/baml](https://github.com/boundaryml/baml) 
        * recommend [getting started video](https://gloochat.notion.site/benefits-of-baml)
    * package managers of choice:
        * Python - [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation)
        * Typescript - PNPM

| 2025-04-08<br/>**reasoning models vs reasoning prompts**<br/>youtube ‚Ä¢ [code](./2025-04-07-reasoning-models-vs-prompts) ‚Ä¢ [RSVP](https://lu.ma/odkhq9a9) | models can reason but you can also reason within a prompt. which technique wins out when and why? we'll find out by adding reasoning to an existing slack ai agent. | 
| 2025-04-15<br/>**code generation with small models**<br/>youtube ‚Ä¢ code ‚Ä¢ [RSVP](https://lu.ma/jvq3ug1g) | large models can do a lot, but so can small models. we'll discuss techniques for how to leverge extremely small models for generating complex sql and cipher queries. |
