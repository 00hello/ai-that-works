title: "S02E06 – Entity Resolution: Extraction, Deduping, and Enriching"
description: Disambiguating many ways of naming the same thing (companies,
  skills, etc.) - from entity extraction to resolution to deduping. We'll
  explore breaking problems into extraction → resolution → enrichment stages,
  scaling with two-stage designs, and building async workflows with
  human-in-loop patterns for production entity resolution systems.
