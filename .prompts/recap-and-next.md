content Content pipeline episode is done. Can you update the main readme and the readme inside the content pipeline episode to match all of the below? And then... T up the description for the next event and add the luma link, etc.

Please rename the episode readme so the readme in 2025-06-24-... matches all the other readmes in the episodes. I will add the whiteboard graphics when you are done.
