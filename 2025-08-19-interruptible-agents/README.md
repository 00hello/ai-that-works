## Episode Summary

This week's >„ ai that works session was all about "Interruptible Agents"! We explored how to build agents that users can guide, correct, and collaborate with in real-time.

Most agents today are "fire-and-forget"you give them a task, and you wait. Interruptible agents let the user jump in, change direction, or provide feedback mid-task. This creates a much more interactive and flexible experience, turning the AI into a true partner.

We covered why this is such a game-changer for UX:

- **From Black Box to Collaborator:** Interruptible agents allow users to jump in, change direction, or provide feedback mid-task, creating a much more interactive and flexible experience that turns the AI into a true partner.

- **Architecture Matters (Threading vs. Loop):** Building this isn't magic. We dove into two main architectures: a simpler main loop that checks for user input between steps, and a more complex multi-threaded model that allows for true simultaneous operation. The choice depends entirely on your application's needs for responsiveness and complexity.

## The One Thing to Remember

> Don't use a framework. The nuances that you build by choosing an architecture is what gives your agent its identity. Own your own identity.

## Key Takeaways

- Interruptible agents transform the user experience by enabling real-time collaboration and course correction
- Choose your architecture based on your needs: simple loop for straightforward cases, threading for true concurrent operation
- The implementation details and nuances of your chosen architecture give your agent its unique identity
- Building from scratch gives you control over the user experience that frameworks can't provide
