## SF workshop pre-requisites


This folder contains the pre-requisites for the SF workshop on 2025-05-17.

You should complete at LEAST folders 00- and 01-, to ensure you have the basic LLM inference stack up

We'll move very quickly through chapters 02- and 03- on saturday so we can get to the more interesting stuff,
so if you have time / are newer to agent building, its recommended to walk through those as well!



### the full version

There are four folders here

- [00-hello-world](./00-hello-world) - basic nodejs and typescript setup steps
- [01-cli-and-agent](./01-cli-and-agent) - set up a basic CLI program that talks to LLMs
- [02-calculator-tools](./02-calculator-tools) - the expected results after completing all the steps in `01-cli-and-agent`, plus steps to add tools
- [03-tool-loop](./03-tool-loop) - the expected results after completing all the steps in `02-calculator-tools`, plus steps to build a simple agentic loop

Each is incremental, that is, 01-cli-and-agent starts off with the expected "end state" from 00

### setting up pre-requisites

- `cd 00-hello-world` and follow the readme steps

when you are done:

- `cd 01-cli-and-agent` and follow the readme steps

etc until you have completed the setup steps.
