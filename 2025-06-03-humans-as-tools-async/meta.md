title: "S02E04 â€“ Humans as Tools: Async Agents and Durable Execution"
description: Agents are great, but for the most accuracy-sensitive scenarios, we
  some times want a human in the loop. Today we'll discuss techniques for how to
  make this possible. We'll dive deep into concepts from our 4/22 session on
  12-factor agents and extend them to handle asynchronous operations where
  agents need to contact humans for help, feedback, or approvals across a
  variety of channels.
