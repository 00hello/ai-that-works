## üéØ Key Takeaways

- **Use Indexes for URLs & Citations**: Provide content with simple IDs (e.g., [SOURCE_1]) and have the LLM output these IDs. Map them back programmatically to improve accuracy and reduce token load.
- **Index-Based Diarization**: For tasks like speaker diarization, have the LLM output the index of the dialogue turn and the identified speaker (e.g., {"dialogue_idx": 0, "speaker": "Nurse"}).
- **Context & "Escape Hatches" for Classification**: Provide relevant context upfront and include an "Other" or "Unknown" category to handle ambiguity.
- **Reasoning via "Busted" JSON/Comments**: Include LLM reasoning as comments or non-standard fields in structured output for easier debugging.
- **Natural Code Generation (in JSON)**: Generate code within Markdown-style backticks as a string field in JSON for higher quality output.
- **RTFP (Read The...Prompt!)**: Carefully review prompts for potential ambiguities that might confuse the LLM.
