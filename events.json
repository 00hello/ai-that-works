Can LLMs even judge their own outputs?\nManaging Latency: Practical methods for reducing delays in your pipeline.\nImproving Accuracy: Techniques to boost the reliability of model outputs.\nImproving Consistency: How do your customers feel confident they'll get the same response\nUnderstanding Technical Challenges:Why are LLMs still non-deterministic even when temperature == 0 or a seed is set?\nWhy are log probabilities unreliable as a confidence metric?\nWhy you probably shouldn't fine-tune (for now)\nScaling Prompt Engineering: Best practices for managing codebases with hundreds of prompts.\nThis interactive session will include live coding, technical explanations, and plenty of time for Q&A.
