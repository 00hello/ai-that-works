title: S02E14 â€“ Decoding Context Engineering Lessons from Manus
description: A few weeks ago, the Manus team published an excellent paper on
  context engineering. It covered KV Cache, Hot-swapping tools with custom
  samplers, and a ton of other cool techniques. On this week's episode, we'll
  dive deep on the manus Article and put some of the advice into practice,
  exploring how a deep understanding of models and inference can help you to get
  the most out of today's LLMs.
