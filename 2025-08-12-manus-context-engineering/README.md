## Episode Highlights

> "Context Engineering is an active process. It's about managing the model's memory with smart cache strategies, structuring inputs for efficiency, and reinforcing key information to guide the LLM, ensuring it stays on-task and performs effectively."

> "Your prompt's structure directly impacts speed and cost. By keeping your system message consistent and placing dynamic variables (like the user's question) at the end of the input, you can intelligently utilize the KV cache, leading to significant performance gains."

> "In long interactions, an LLM can lose track of the original goal. Instead of relying on its memory, periodically re-inject relevant information or tasks to reinforce the context."

> "Be judicious with few-shot promptingâ€”use it only when needed and structure examples properly to avoid biasing the output."

## Key Takeaways

1. **Optimize Your Cache, Optimize Your Performance**: Your prompt's structure directly impacts speed and cost. By keeping your system message consistent and placing dynamic variables (like the user's question) at the end of the input, you can intelligently utilize the KV cache, leading to significant performance gains.

2. **Reinforce Context, Don't Just Assume**: In long interactions, an LLM can lose track of the original goal. Instead of relying on its memory, periodically re-inject relevant information or tasks to reinforce the context. Also, be judicious with few-shot promptingâ€”use it only when needed and structure examples properly to avoid biasing the output.

3. **Investigate Token Production**: Investigate how an LLM produces tokens to understand context representations better. This deeper understanding helps you craft more effective prompts and manage context more efficiently.

4. **Smart Variable Management**: Handle tool calls and dynamic variables thoughtfully. Consider re-injecting relevant information or tasks periodically to reinforce context rather than relying solely on immediate observations.
