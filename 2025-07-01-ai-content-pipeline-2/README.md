# ðŸ¦„ Boosting AI Output Quality

> This week's ai that works session was a bit meta! We explored "Boosting AI Output Quality" by building the very AI pipeline that generated this email from our Zoom recording.

## Key Takeaways

1. **It's an Architecture Problem, Not a Prompt Problem** - Before you write a single prompt, you have to whiteboard the data flow. Getting the data plumbing rightâ€”making sure all the correct links, dates, and topics are availableâ€”is 90% of the battle.

2. **Use a Two-Step "Extract, then Polish" Pipeline** - The real breakthrough was separating the task into two steps. First, a dedicated LLM call extracts the raw facts and key points from the transcript into a structured format. Then, a second LLM call polishes those facts into a well-toned message. This avoids that robotic, "Mad Libs" feel and gives you much higher quality output.

> If you remember one thing from this session: High-quality AI generation isn't about one magic prompt. It's an engineered system that first extracts facts reliably and then polishes them for tone and flow. Separate your data pipeline from your creative pipeline.

## Running the Code

```bash
# Backend setup
cd backend
uv sync
cp env.template .env
# Configure your environment variables

# Frontend setup
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Run the full pipeline
uv run python main.py
```
