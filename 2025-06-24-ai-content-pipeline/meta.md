title: S02E07 â€“ Building an AI Content Pipeline
description: Content creation involves a lot of manual work - uploading videos,
  sending emails, and other follow-up tasks that are easy to drop. We'll build
  an agent that integrates YouTube, email, GitHub and human-in-the-loop to fully
  automate the AI that Works content pipeline, handling all the repetitive work
  while maintaining quality.
