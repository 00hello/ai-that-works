the worst way to use a coding agent: just stuff everything into context until you hit 200k tokens and wonder why the agent gets confused

also dumb: using compact instead of intentional steering. `/compact` is designed to work "okay" for every use case, which means its GUARANTEED to be-suboptimal for your use case compared to a more specialized approach based on your code, task, etc.

sub-agents are the cheat code nobody talks about

main agent: "yo find where we load user data"
sub-agent: *searches 50 files, returns exactly what u need*
main agent: *continues with clean context*

its like having junior devs that never complain

a bad line of code is a bad line of code. But as you move higher up the chain towards spec-driven development the impact multiplier is pretty real:

- bad plan → 10-100 bad lines of code
- bad research → 1000+ bad lines of code
- bad spec → 10,000+ bad lines of code
- bad prompts or CLAUDE.md → 100k+ bad lines of code  

focus human effort on the HIGHEST LEVERAGE parts of the pipeline

the 3-phase approach that actually works:

1. research phase - understand the system (with its own agent)
2. planning phase - build the roadmap (review this!!)  
3. implementation - execute with confidence

each phase gets fresh context. no confusion.

reject bad research. create two plans. implement both in parallel.

sounds crazy but hear me out - sometimes the "no research" plan is better than overthinking it

let the implementations race and see which one wins
