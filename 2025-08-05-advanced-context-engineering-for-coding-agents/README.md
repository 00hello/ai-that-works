## Episode Summary

This week's ðŸ¦„ ai that works session was on "Advanced Context Engineering for Coding Agents"!

We covered a ton on how to get the most out of coding agents. Here are key takeaways you can apply today:

- **Use sub-agents for complex tasks:** Instead of one monolithic prompt, decompose the problem. Use specialized prompts for sub-tasks like planning, identifying relevant files, and then generating the code.

- **Use intentional compaction:** Actively manage and shrink your context to keep the agent focused on what's most important.

- **Align language and naming:** Use consistent naming conventions across your codebase to make it easier for the AI to understand the relationships between different parts.

- **Review markdown docs to catch problems BEFORE implementation:** Review the research and plan the agent creates to foster mental alignment and ensure it's on the right track.

- **Practice exploratory coding:** Work alongside your agent to build your own intuition and spot where the AI excels and where it needs guidance.

- **CLAUDE.md > prompts > research > plans > implementation:** Focus human effort on the highest-leverage parts of the pipeline.

- **Phase 1 - Research:** Understanding the problem and how the system works today, including filenames.

- **Phase 2 - Planning:** Building a step-by-step outline of the changes to make.

- **Phase 3 - Implementation:** Executing the plan, testing as you go, ready for surprises along the way.

## The One Thing to Remember

> Context engineering isn't just about cramming more stuff into the prompt; it's a deliberate practice of structuring, compacting, and aligning information to make your AI agent a more effective partner.
