6. **Socials**
   - create a socials.md file in the just-completed episode folder with Twitter posts based on the whiteboard images from the episode
   - Find all whiteboard images in the episode's README.md (usually 3-4 images)
   - For each whiteboard image:
     - Use 'Bash(wget)' to download and preview the image 
     - Create a Twitter post that captures the key insight from that specific whiteboard
     - Keep it short, casual language, include some questionable grammar
     - Each post should teach one specific lesson from the whiteboard
     - End each post with "link to full episode with Vaibhav on llm [topic] in comments"
   - Format: "### Twitter post 1", "### Twitter post 2", etc.
   - After all image posts, add a final "### Links" section with:
     - link to code from the episode: github.com/hellovai/ai-that-works/tree/main/EPISODE_FOLDER/
     - sign up for the next livestream tuesday at 10am PT - [get link from README]
   - your main goal is to get people to sign up for the next episode - make it sound fun, drop one or two interesting wisdoms and MOST IMPORTANTLY get straight to the point. NO FLUFF
   - Skip LinkedIn posts - Twitter only
