title: Claude for Non-Code Tasks
description: "On #17 we talked about advanced context engineering workflows for
  using Claude code to work in complex codebases. This week, we're gonna get a
  little weird with it, and show off a bunch of ways you can use Claude Code as
  a generic agent to handle non-coding tasks. We'll learn things like: Skipping
  the MCP and having claude write its own scripts to interact with external
  systems, Creating internal knowledge graphs with markdown files, How to blend
  agentic retrieval and search with deterministic context packing"
