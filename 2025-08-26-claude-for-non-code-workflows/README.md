## Episode Highlights

> "Instead of building a full-blown personal CRM, what if you just used a simple Markdown file? We showed how you can maintain a `crm.md` file, dump your notes and interactions into it, and then use Claude as an intelligent assistant to query and update it."

> "You can ask questions like 'Who did I talk to about vector databases last week?' or 'Summarize my last conversation with Jane from Acme Corp.' This is a powerful workflow that requires zero database setup."

> "Markdown as a Database: For many tasks, a structured text file is a perfectly goodâ€”and much simplerâ€”database."

> "Context Engineering over Code: The magic isn't in writing a new application, but in engineering the context (the prompt and the .md file) to make the LLM a useful tool in your existing workflow."

## Key Takeaways

- You can build powerful "no-code" tools by combining LLMs with simple formats like Markdown. The key is to think in terms of effective workflows and context engineering, not just agentic automation.

- Instead of complex software systems, simple Markdown files can serve as effective databases for many personal and professional use cases when paired with LLMs.

- Context engineering (how you structure prompts and data) is often more important than building new applications. Focus on creating workflows that leverage existing tools intelligently.

- The demonstrated personal CRM example shows how a simple `.md` file plus Claude can replace complex database-backed applications for many use cases.
