## Key Takeaways

- You can build powerful "no-code" tools by combining LLMs with simple formats like Markdown. The key is to think in terms of effective workflows and context engineering.

- Skip the MCP servers - Claude can one-shot most API integrations

- Build tools that create deterministic context compacting with `head` or by slicing file collections using frontmatter.

- BurritoNow CRM example shows how a simple `.md` file plus Claude can replace complex database-backed applications for many use cases.
